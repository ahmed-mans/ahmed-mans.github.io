    "about": " I’m Ahmed, a passionate Computer Vision Engineer based in Belgium. I thrive on transforming complex visual data into intelligent, actionable insights. My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technologies, experiment with deep learning models, and stay up-to-date with the latest research in the computer vision world.\n\nOver the years, I’ve worked on a variety of projects that blend innovation and real-world problem solving. Whether it’s implementing object detection systems, working with neural networks, or optimizing pipelines, I enjoy every step of the journey from concept to deployment.\n\nOutside of tech, I’m a huge football fan, a lover of the outdoors, and an avid reader. Hiking through nature or diving into a good book helps keep my mind balanced and inspired.\n\nI'm always excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts, collaborate on cool ideas, or simply share knowledge. Let’s build something amazing together!"
